# Pomodoro Timer

This is a Pomodoro Timer built using Python's Tkinter library. It is a simple desktop application designed to help you manage your work and break intervals using the Pomodoro Technique. The timer alternates between work sessions and short/long breaks, helping you stay productive and focused.

## Features

- **Work Timer**: A configurable work timer (default is 2 minutes).
- **Short Break Timer**: A configurable short break timer (default is 1 minute).
- **Long Break Timer**: A configurable long break timer (default is 3 minutes after every 4 work sessions).
- **Start and Reset**: Start and reset buttons to control the timer.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pooja389/tomato-timer.git
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
3. Make sure the required libraries are installed. You can install Tkinter (if not already installed) using:
   ```bash
   pip install tk
4. Add the tomato.png image (or your custom image) in the same directory as your pomodoro_timer.py file.
## Usage
1. Open the pomodoro_timer.py file.
2. Run the script. A window will open with a timer, a start button, and a reset button.
3. click "Start" to begin the Pomodoro cycle.
4. When the timer reaches 0, it will automatically switch to the next session (work or break).
5. Click "Reset" to stop the timer and reset it to 00:00.
